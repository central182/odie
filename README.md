# Odie

Odie is a CLI wrapper of the [Oxford Dictionaries API](https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/).
This is currently a toy project and is not intended to be fully compatible with the Oxford Dictionaries API.

> [Oxford Dictionaries Premium](https://premium.oxforddictionaries.com/) provides a greater experience in the browser with a lower cost.
> I would definitely recommend it as the alternative to the discontinued lexico.com.
